I added the data set of covid-19 that containing the data of all over the world.
The site for accessing the real-time dataset - https://ourworldindata.org/

1. coviddeaths(.xlsx)  - where all the data about the new cases,total cases,new deaths,total deaths present according the continent, location,date.
2. CovidVaccination(.xlsx)  - where all the data about the new tests,total tests,new vaccinations,total vaccinations present according the continent, location,date.
