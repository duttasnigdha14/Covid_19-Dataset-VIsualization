I added the data set of covid-19 that containing the data of all over the world.
The site for accessing the real-time dataset - https://ourworldindata.org/

Then, I divided the data into two tables-
1. coviddeaths(.xlsx)  - where all the data about the new cases,total cases,new deaths,total deaths present according the continent, location,date.
2. CovidVaccination(.xlsx)  - where all the data about the new tests,total tests,new vaccinations,total vaccinations present according the continent, location,date.


then I clean the data according to my preference and gather my information from that.

Then I import my excel sheets into MS-SQL Serever for Further analysis.The data that I get after running SQL query , Further store into another excel sheet for Visualization.
The information that I got from queries -
1.Total cases,total deaths and Death Percentage across the world.
2.Infected countries by total cases
3.Highest cases among the continents
4.Vaccinated Information
5.Vaccination rate over population of each country.

Visualized all the information in Tableau-https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/snigdha.dutta/viz/COVID-19GlobalStatus_16821570240700/Dashboard12
